# Neko-Love API V4 (Go / Fiber Rewrite)

> A community-powered rewrite of the original Neko-Love API, rebuilt in Go with the Fiber web framework.

---

## üåü What is this?

This project is a **modern reimplementation of the original Neko-Love API**, which was once hosted at `neko-love.xyz`. It served random anime-style images like "neko", "hug", "kiss", and more ‚Äî often used in Discord bots, anime projects, and other community tools.

The original API was written in Node.js using Koa. This version is a **fresh and solid base built with Go and the Fiber framework**, designed for others to easily clone, customize, and host themselves.

---

## üîß Goals

- Provide a **lightweight and fast** REST API to serve random images.
- Offer a **clean modular structure** for adding new routes, categories, and assets.
- **SFW only**: This version contains strictly Safe For Work content.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Please Note

This API **is not hosted by the original author**.

> It is provided as an open-source base only. You are free to clone, modify, self-host, and integrate it into your own projects.

---

## üöÄ Quick Overview

- Each route returns a random image from a local folder (e.g. `/assets/neko/`)
- Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:3030/api/images/neko/04.webp"
}
```

- Images are served at `/images/<category>/<image>`

---

## üö© Why a new version?

> After the original API was shut down, several community members asked if they could bring it back. Unfortunately, the original source code was lost. This rewrite aims to provide a fresh, modern foundation.

- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain  
- ‚úÖ Fast and lightweight (Go + Fiber)  
- ‚úÖ Clean structure for contributions
